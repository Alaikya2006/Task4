The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various medical attributes provided in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The workflow includes loading and preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, standardizing the features, and training a logistic regression model using scikit-learn. After training, the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score. Additionally, the sigmoid function used in logistic regression is explored, and the decision threshold is adjusted to analyze its impact on model performance. This task helps reinforce fundamental concepts of binary classification and model evaluation techniques in machine learning
